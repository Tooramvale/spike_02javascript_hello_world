Spike Plan
==============

**Name**: "Alex Sonneveld <alex.sonneveld@live.com.au>"

## Context:
"Hello World" is a simple program to test that the computer can run code.

**Knowledge/Skill/Technology Gap:**
The developer is not aware or familiar with JavaScript and needs to setup their
workstation to compile code written in JavaScript for their future self-projects
or external projects.

## Goals/Deliverables:
**[GIT REPOSITORY (CODE)] + [SPIKE REPORT]**

- You need to create a simple "Hello World" application in JavaScript
- It needs to compile
- It should display the text "Hello World" to the screen, when executed.
  (The executable can be committed along side the source code, but even if it is
  not you need to detail how to compile said program so that the reviewer can
  compile it on their machine)

This program should be the absolute minimum needed to write a program in
JavaScript.

You need will need upload your copy of this Git repository, your with code and
your Spike Report that describes the steps involved to setup your machine
(and/or potentially other remote machines) to run your JavaScript code.

Your reports should be in Markdown (or similar text format), so that the can be
reviewed within the browser, or opened with the default text editor installed on
the operating system (please NO Microsoft Word documents).

**Planned start date:**  2017/03/06

**Deadline:**  2017/03/15

## Planning notes:
- !IMPORTANT! There are two ways to run JavaScript:
   1. Is in the browser
   2. From the console (via Node or IO)

- Review the Goals/Deliverables (above)
- Review the recommended sources (below)
- Read the _online_ documentation for JavaScript
- Commit your work to Git
- Upload your finished report (in Markdown preferred) and provide a link

**Extras / Bonus Points:**

- What bugs did you encounter?
- Can you execute the compiled (or interpreted) program on another machine, if
  not why?
- Why is called JavaScript, is related to Java?
